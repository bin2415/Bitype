What's New in Extra Clang Tools 7.0.0?
======================================

Some of the major new features and improvements to Extra Clang Tools are listed
here. Generic improvements to Extra Clang Tools as a whole or to its underlying
infrastructure are described first, followed by tool-specific sections.

Major New Features
------------------

Improvements to clang-query

Improvements to clang-rename
----------------------------

The improvements are...

Improvements to clang-tidy
--------------------------

- New module `abseil` for checks related to the `Abseil <https://abseil.io>`_
  library.

- New module ``portability``.

- New module ``zircon`` for checks related to Fuchsia's Zircon kernel.

- New :doc:`bugprone-throw-keyword-missing
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-throw-keyword-missing>` check

  Diagnoses when a temporary object that appears to be an exception is
  constructed but not thrown.

- New :doc:`bugprone-unused-return-value
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-unused-return-value>` check

  Warns on unused function return values.

- New :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-avoid-goto
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-avoid-goto>` check

  The usage of ``goto`` for control flow is error prone and should be replaced
  with looping constructs. Every backward jump is rejected. Forward jumps are
  only allowed in nested loops.

- New :doc:`fuchsia-multiple-inheritance
  <clang-tidy/checks/fuchsia-multiple-inheritance>` check

  Warns if a class inherits from multiple classes that are not pure virtual.

- New :doc:`abseil-string-find-startswith
  <clang-tidy/checks/abseil-string-find-startswith>` check

  Checks whether a ``std::string::find()`` result is compared with 0, and
  suggests replacing with ``absl::StartsWith()``.

- New :doc:`fuchsia-statically-constructed-objects
  <clang-tidy/checks/fuchsia-statically-constructed-objects>` check

  Warns if global, non-trivial objects with static storage are constructed,
  unless the object is statically initialized with a ``constexpr`` constructor
  or has no explicit constructor.

- New :doc:`fuchsia-trailing-return
  <clang-tidy/checks/fuchsia-trailing-return>` check

  Functions that have trailing returns are disallowed, except for those
  using ``decltype`` specifiers and lambda with otherwise unutterable
  return types.

- New :doc:`hicpp-multiway-paths-covered
  <clang-tidy/checks/hicpp-multiway-paths-covered>` check

  Checks on ``switch`` and ``if`` - ``else if`` constructs that do not cover all possible code paths.

- New :doc:`modernize-use-uncaught-exceptions
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize-use-uncaught-exceptions>` check

  Finds and replaces deprecated uses of ``std::uncaught_exception`` to
  ``std::uncaught_exceptions``.

- New :doc:`portability-simd-intrinsics
  <clang-tidy/checks/portability-simd-intrinsics>` check

  Warns or suggests alternatives if SIMD intrinsics are used which can be replaced by
  ``std::experimental::simd`` operations.

- New :doc:`zircon-temporary-objects
  <clang-tidy/checks/zircon-temporary-objects>` check

  Warns on construction of specific temporary objects in the Zircon kernel.

- New alias :doc:`hicpp-avoid-goto
  <clang-tidy/checks/hicpp-avoid-goto>` to :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-avoid-goto
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-avoid-goto>`
